 * Invoke fork() during a test and assign the child to the same
 * process group that the rest of the test case uses.
 *
 * One can invoke fork() directly during a test; however doing so
 * may not guarantee that any children processes are destroyed once
 * the test finishes. Once a test has completed, all processes in
 * the process group will be killed; using this wrapper will prevent
 * orphan processes.
 *
 * If Check is compiled without fork() support this call simply
 * return -1 and does nothing.
 *
 * @return On success, the PID of the child process is returned in
 *          the parent, and 0 is returned in the child.  On failure,
 *          a value of -1 is returned to the parent process and no
 *          child process is created.
