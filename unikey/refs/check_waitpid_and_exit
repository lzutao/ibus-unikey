 * This is to be used in conjunction with check_fork(). When called,
 * will wait for the given process to terminate. If the process
 * exited without error, exit(EXIT_SUCCESS) is invoked; otherwise
 * exit(EXIT_FAILURE) is invoked.
 *
 * If Check is compiled without support for fork(), this invokes
 * exit(EXIT_FAILURE).
