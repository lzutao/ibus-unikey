 * ibus_input_context_process_hand_writing_event:
 * @context: An IBusInputContext.
 * @coordinates: An array of gdouble (0.0 to 1.0) which represents a stroke (i.e. [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, ...]).
 * @coordinates_len: The number of elements in the array. The number should be even and &gt;= 4.
 *
 * Pass a handwriting stroke to an input method engine.
 *
 * In this API, a coordinate (0.0, 0.0) represents the top-left corner of an area for
 * handwriting, and (1.0, 1.0) does the bottom-right. Therefore, for example, if
 * a user writes a character &apos;L&apos;, the array would be something like [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
 * and coordinates_len would be 6.
 *
 * The function is usually called when a user releases the mouse button in a hand
 * writing area.
