 * ibus_proxy_destroy:
 * @proxy: An #IBusProxy
 *
 * Dispose the proxy object. If the dbus connection is alive and the own
 * variable above is TRUE (which is the default),
 * org.freedesktop.IBus.Service.Destroy method will be called.
 * Note that &quot;destroy&quot; signal might be emitted when ibus_proxy_destroy is
 * called or the underlying dbus connection for the proxy is terminated.
 * In the callback of the destroy signal, you might have to call something
 * like &apos;g_object_unref(the_proxy);&apos;.
