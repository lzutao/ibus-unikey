Instructions on how to add more charset supports

Each charset enumerates all its characters according to a fixed order.
To understand this order, copy the TCVN3 charset bellow to some application
and view it with some TCVN3 font.

Steps to add an 1-byte charset:

- Determine the Id for your charset. See &quot;vnconv.h&quot;. The Id
  for your charset is equal to the id of the last 1-byte charset PLUS 1.
  Then define a constant for that Id (e.g. #define MY_NEW_CHARSET 25)
- In &quot;vnconv.h&quot;: Increase the variable CONV_TOTAL_SINGLE_CHARSETS by 1.
- Add an entry for your charset to the end of CharsetIdMap (in this file)
- Add your charset to the end of SingleBytesTable
- Note that and the end of each charset (after character z) there&apos;s a section
  for the symbols in western charsets (see TCVN3). Just copy
  this section for your charset, and set zero for each code point
  that is occupied by your charset (for representing Vietnamese characters).

Steps to add a 2-byte charset:
- Determine the Id for your charset. See &quot;vnconv.h&quot;. The Id
  for your charset is equal to the id of the last 2-byte charset PLUS 1.
  Then define a constant for that Id (e.g. #define MY_NEW_CHARSET 44)
- In &quot;vnconv.h&quot;: Increase the variable CONV_TOTAL_DOUBLE_CHARSETS by 1.
- Add an entry for your charset to the end of CharsetIdMap (in this file)
- Add your charset to the end of DoubleByteTables
- Note that and the end of each charset (after character z) there&apos;s a section
  for the symbols in western charsets. Just copy this section from
  VNI-WIN charset to your charset
- Double-byte characters are represented as a word in which the
  low byte is base character, high byte is tone mark (if present).
