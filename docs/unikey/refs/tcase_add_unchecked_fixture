<doc f='include/check.h' l='279'>/**
 * Add unchecked fixture setup/teardown functions to a test case
 *
 * Unchecked fixture functions are run at the start and end of the
 * test case, and not before and after unit tests. Further,
 * unchecked fixture functions are not run in a separate address space,
 * like test functions, and so must not exit or signal (e.g.,
 * segfault).
 *
 * Also, when run in CK_NOFORK mode, unchecked fixture functions may
 * lead to different unit test behavior if unit tests change data
 * setup by the fixture functions.
 *
 * Note that if a setup function fails, the remaining setup functions
 * will be omitted, as will the test case and the teardown functions.
 * If a teardown function fails the remaining teardown functins will be
 * omitted.
 *
 * @param tc test case to add unchecked fixture setup/teardown to
 * @param setup function to add to be executed before the test case;
 *               if NULL no setup function is added
 * @param teardown function to add to be executed after the test case;
 *               if NULL no teardown function is added
