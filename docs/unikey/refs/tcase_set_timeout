 * Set the timeout for all tests in a test case.
 *
 * A test that lasts longer than the timeout (in seconds) will be killed
 * and thus fail with an error.
 *
 * If not set, the default timeout is one assigned at compile time. If
 * the environment variable CK_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT is defined and no timeout
 * is set, the value in the environment variable is used.
 *
 * If Check is compile without fork() support this call is ignored,
 * as timeouts are not possible.
 *
 * @param tc test case to assign timeout to
 * @param timeout to use, in seconds. If the value contains a decimal
 *                 portion, but no high resolution timer is available,
 *                 the value is rounded up to the nearest second.
